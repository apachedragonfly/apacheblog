Hi, my name is Jeremy.
Thanks for paying me a visit today!

I am an aspiring writer, musician, programmer, and avid learner.

I am searching for the optimal experience. On my journey I plan to discover my full potential.

## The Website
This website was created using <a href="https://github.com/mkchoi212/paper-jekyll-theme">Paper</a>, a Jekyll theme created by <a href="https://deadbeef.me">Mike Choi</a>.

If you have anything interesting to send me or if you want to talk about anything, feel free to e-mail me <a href="apachedragonfly@protonmail.com">here</a>.

## Apache Dragonfly?

The name of this website is based upon an experience I had a few years ago that changed my life and how my brain works (for the better).

I will elaborate further eventually.
